ðŸ¦‰ Elux is a fully hackable, TypeScript-first, fullstack web framework with support for server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). It's built entirely from scratch with no React dependency and no unnecessary abstractions, giving you complete control over every layer - client, server, routing, rendering, styles, and plugins. It's fast by design, powered by Vite for instant dev feedback and optimized builds. Just for fun
