ðŸ¦‰ Elux is a fully hackable, TypeScript-first, fullstack web framework with support for server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). It's built entirely from scratch with no React dependency and no unnecessary abstractions, giving you complete control over every layer â€” client, server, routing, rendering, styles, and plugins. It's fast by design, powered by Vite for instant dev feedback and optimized builds. The project was made primarily for myself because I'm tired of frameworks that try to do everything for you while locking you into their way of thinking. I don't want helpers. I want raw access. If that's you too, welcome.

The structure is simple and intentional: app/ holds your views and routes using file-based routing, framework/ contains the core logic (client, server, plugins), and everything else is minimal boilerplate â€” no clutter. Built-in features include fast refresh, clean error overlays, dark mode toggling, image optimization, and a tiny custom utility CSS framework that doesn't bring along a giant theme engine. Plugins are opt-in and zero-config where possible: Auth.js for authentication, Prisma for ORM/database access, Stripe for payments, and AI integrations for tools like OpenAI, Claude, or Gemini. You only bring in what you need, and everything can be overridden or extended. No black boxes, just code. You can even treat Elux as a starter kit to build your _own_ custom framework from it â€” strip it down, fork it, tune it to your stack and style, and own the whole pipeline.

To get started, git clone, npm install && npm run dev. Development is frictionless, builds are fast, and production setup is dead simple. There's a clear CLI (npm run dev, build, start, lint) and a layout that prioritizes DX and performance. This isn't a "batteries included" framework â€” it's a "build your own lab" starting point. Documentation is available at [https://canguden.github.io/elux-docs/](https://canguden.github.io/elux-docs/), and contributions are welcome if you speak fluent TypeScript and share the same desire for complete creative control. Elux is licensed under MIT and designed to stay lean, understandable, and absolutely yours. The project is still under construction and evolving rapidly â€” a full set of docs and examples will follow as it stabilizes.
